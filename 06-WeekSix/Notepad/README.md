### Notepad
#### Description
This Java program implements a simple Notepad application that allows the user to input text and save it to a file named "notepad.txt". When the program is run, it first prints the last saved text from the file, if any. Then, it prompts the user to enter text. The user can continue entering text until they type ":q" to exit. Each time the user enters text, it is saved to the file. If an error occurs during the saving process, an error message is displayed. The program uses BufferedReader and BufferedWriter to read from and write to the file, respectively, and Scanner to get input from the user.

#### Requirements
- JDK Version is minimum [JDK8](https://www.oracle.com/tr/java/technologies/downloads/).
